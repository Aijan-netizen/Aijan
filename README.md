# 📌 Project README

## 📖 Overview
This project includes three Python programs that demonstrate working with tuples, dictionaries, and Pandas data structures. Each program executes specific tasks and outputs corresponding results.

---

## 📂 Programs and Expected Output

### 🏠 1. `myfamily.py`

#### ✨ Functionality:
 ✔ Defines a tuple containing family member roles.
 ✔ Prints the tuple and its type.
 ✔ Accesses and prints specific items using index numbers.
 ✔ Attempts to modify the tuple using `append()` and `pop()`, resulting in errors since tuples are immutable.

#### 🔍 Expected Output:
📌 Tuple contents and type.
📌 Specific tuple values accessed by index.
📌 Errors confirming tuple immutability.

---

### 💻 2. `laptop.py`

#### ✨ Functionality:
✔ Defines a dictionary containing laptop details.
✔ Retrieves and prints the brand value.
✔ Adds a new key-value pair (`home: True`).
✔ Modifies an existing value (`year` changed to 2019).

#### 🔍 Expected Output:
📌 Brand of the laptop.
📌 Updated dictionary including the new key-value pair.
📌 Modified dictionary reflecting the updated year.

---

### 👤 3. `user.py`

#### ✨ Functionality:
✔ Collects user information via input prompts.
✔ Stores the collected data in a dictionary.
✔ Displays the stored information in a structured format.

#### 🔍 Expected Output:
📌 User-entered details printed in a formatted manner.

---

### 📊 4. Additional Pandas Implementation

#### ✨ Functionality:
✔ Creates and prints a Pandas `Series` for months.
✔ Defines a `Series` with student counts per department.
✔ Constructs a `DataFrame` containing exam data and prints it.
✔ Filters and prints rows where attempts exceed 2.

#### 🔍 Expected Output:
📌 Printed Pandas `Series` and `DataFrame`.
📌 Filtered subset of the `DataFrame` displaying attempts greater than 2.
