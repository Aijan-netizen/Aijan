# SECOND ASSIGNMENT 
## Book Class 
This project contains a `Book` class written in Python. It demonstrates object-oriented programming by defining attributes and methods for a book.
### Class Description  
 - Attributes:
   - 'title' (str): The title of the book.
   - 'author' (str): The author of the book.
   - 'ISBN' (str): The International Standard Book Number of the book (optional).
   - 'price' (float): The price of the book (optional).
 - Constructors:
   - Parameterized constructor: Initializes all attributes with specific values.
   - Default constructor: Initializes attributes with default values (None for string attributes and 0.0 for price).
 - Methods:  
   - 'info()' - Displays book details(title, author, ISBN, price).  
   - 'read()' - Simulates reading the book by printing a message "You are reading (book title).". 

# THIRD ASSIGNMENT
## Personal Account Management
This is a Python program to manage a personal bank account. It allows users to:
 - Deposit money
 - Withdraw money (with balance checks)
 - Check account balance
 - View transaction history.

The program uses two classes:
 - `Amount`: Represents a single transaction (deposit or withdrawal).
 - `PersonalAccount`: Manages the account, including balance, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history.

##  How It Works  
### üîπ Account Setup:  
- The user provides their **account number** and **name**.  
### üîπ Menu Options:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Deposit** ‚Äì Adds money to the account.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Withdraw** ‚Äì Removes money from the account, with a check to ensure there are sufficient funds.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Balance** ‚Äì Displays the current balance.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transaction History** ‚Äì Shows all past transactions (deposits and withdrawals).  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Exit** ‚Äì Exits the program.

## What I Have Done
 - Created the `Amount` class to handle transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
 - Created the `PersonalAccount` class to manage the account balance and transaction history.
 - Implemented a menu system for user interaction.
 - Added balance checks before withdrawals to prevent overdraft.
