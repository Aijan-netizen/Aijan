## Personal Account Management
This Python program provides a simple personal bank account management system, allowing users to:

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance checks)
- Check account balance
- View transaction history

### Features

- **Class-based Structure**: Uses `Transaction` and `BankAccount` classes for better data organization.
- **Transaction History**: Records deposits and withdrawals.
- **Balance Validation**: Prevents overdraft by checking available balance before withdrawals.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Allows easy navigation between actions.

## How It Works

### üîπ Account Setup:
- The user provides an **account number** and **name**.

### üîπ Menu Options:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Deposit** ‚Äì Adds money to the account.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Withdraw** ‚Äì Removes money from the account (if sufficient funds exist).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Balance** ‚Äì Displays the current balance.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transaction History** ‚Äì Shows all past transactions.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Exit** ‚Äì Exits the program.

## Implementation Details

- **`Transaction` Class**: Represents an individual transaction.
- **`BankAccount` Class**: Manages balance and transaction history.
- **Interactive Menu**: Allows users to interact with the account easily.
